# Greedy purity, VDR, and the nature of the block 10 variance

Status: **reference document**. Read this if you are shipping block 10
(`10-k-quant-boosts.patch`) and care about bit-exact reproduction of greedy
decode vs a stock llama.cpp build. It explains *why* block 10 changes decode
numerics, what that does and does not mean for correctness, and how to reason
about the variance in practice.

## 1. The one-sentence version

Block 10 does not make decode any more or less *correct* than stock — it
computes the **same real-number result** through a **different order of fp32
additions**, which produces a different (equally valid) rounding path; stock
is not the mathematically special order, it is just the *reference standard*
that was chosen first and that everything else reproduces.

## 2. What block 10 changes

Block 10 is the single patch in the set that alters decode numerics. It does
so through two mechanisms, both in the mmvq decode path:

| mechanism | change | effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **VDR (vectors-per-thread reduction)** | `VDR_Q4_K_Q8_1_MMVQ 2→4`, `VDR_Q5_K_Q8_1_MMVQ 2→4`, `VDR_Q8_0_Q8_1_MMVQ 2→4`, `VDR_Q6_K_Q8_1_MMVQ 1→2` | each thread accumulates 4 (or 2) chunk partials serially instead of 2 (or 1) |
| **RDNA3_5 parameter table** (ex-block 06) | `MMVQ_PARAMETERS_RDNA3_5` split from the RDNA2 fallback, `nwarps=2` for Q8_0 on gfx1151 | fewer warps → different cross-warp combine tree |

Everything else in block 10 (the mmq prefill scale-load hoist, the MoE mmid
whitelist, the perf-harness cases) is arithmetic-preserving or test-only and
does not change any production numerics.

## 3. The reduction structure (identical machinery, different leaf assignment)

The decode kernel `mul_mat_vec_q` (in `mmvq.cu`) computes each output row as
a dot product of quantized x/y blocks. The dot products themselves are
**exact**: `ggml_cuda_dp4a` is an integer SIMD dot product, and the scale
multiplications `d8 * (dot1 * sc)` are single multiplies. The only place
rounding can differ is the **fp32 accumulation**:

```
// per-thread serial chain:
for (int kbx = tid/(qi/vdr); kbx < blocks_per_row_x; kbx += blocks_per_iter) {
    tmp[j][i] += vec_dot_q_cuda(...);        // ONE serial add per iteration
}
// cross-thread combine (identical in stock and block 10):
tmp[j][i] += tmp_shared[l][j][i][threadIdx.x];   // across warps (shared memory)
tmp[j][i]  = warp_reduce_sum<warp_size>(tmp[j][i]); // across lanes (shuffle tree)
```

`warp_reduce_sum` is a fixed, hard-coded binary tree:

```cpp
for (int offset = width/2; offset > 0; offset >>= 1)
    x += __shfl_xor_sync(0xffffffff, x, offset, width);   // 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
```

**Crucially, the cross-thread tree is byte-identical in both paths.** What
VDR changes is *which* partial sums feed which leaves of that tree, and how
many serial adds happen per thread before the tree runs.

## 4. Why VDR changes the rounding path

FP32 addition is **not associative**: `(a+b)+c` and `a+(b+c)` can round
differently. For a fixed row, the VDR value determines:

- `blocks_per_iter = vdr * nwarps*warp_size / qi` — how many chunks each
  thread owns per iteration (doubles from VDR=2 to VDR=4),
- the per-thread serial chain length (2 chunks then a `tmp +=` at VDR=2;
  4 chunks then a `tmp +=` at VDR=4),
- `kqs = vdr * (tid % (qi/vdr))` — which quant groups each thread touches.

So the *set* of partial products is identical, but the *association order*
of their summation differs: stock effectively rounds `((c0+c1)+(c2+c3))`
through the tree, block 10 rounds `(((c0+c1)+c2)+c3)` per thread before the
tree — and the thread-to-chunk assignment is different too. Same math,
different rounding events.

### A note on "fewer rounding accumulations"

If anything, the VDR=4 path does **fewer** serial rounding steps per thread,
not more: for the same K, `blocks_per_iter` doubles, so the outer `tmp +=`
chain runs half as often, and the internal adds amortize over more chunks
(~17% fewer serial fp32 adds per thread at VDR=4, measured from the loop
structure). This is not a claim of higher accuracy — it is simply evidence
that "more rounding happens in the boosted path" is not the correct
intuition. Both paths round a comparable number of times in comparable
magnitude ranges; neither is provably closer to the exact result.

## 5. What "correctness" means here — and what it doesn't

- **Same real-number result.** In exact arithmetic, every VDR configuration
  computes the identical dot product. There is no approximation being
  introduced — the products are exact, the scales are exact, the sums are of
  the same terms.
- **Stock is not more correct.** The upstream ordering was chosen by the
  original author for performance and simplicity on the hardware of the day,
  not because it is the mathematically optimal summation order. There is no
  correctness bound, no error analysis, no "canonical" association in the
  reference implementation — it is simply the ordering that shipped first.
- **Block 10 is not less correct.** It is a different, equally deterministic
  path through the same fp32 approximation space.
- **"Bit-identical to stock" is a reproducibility requirement, not a
  correctness requirement.** It matters when you need byte-exact comparison
  against stock output: golden test vectors, cross-build test harnesses,
  speculative-verify batches that must match decode (the `ncols_dst <=
  MMVQ_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` rule), or audit trails. If your goal is to reproduce
  stock's bits, you must reproduce stock's exact association order — that is
  the entire reason block 10 is structured as one excludable patch.

## 6. Measured magnitude of the variance

From the validation runs on gfx1201 (ROCm 7.14):

| metric | value | meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| max |logit| diff (block 10 in vs out) | **0.184** | the largest single-logit change anywhere in the test prompts |
| same, for flash-attn on vs off (yardstick) | 0.203 | a variance source already accepted upstream — block 10's drift is comparable to it |
| per-token probability change at the max-diff logit | ~20% at t=1.0 | *modest*, not astronomically small — see note below |
| logit magnitude in the top region | ~10–30 nats | 0.184 is ~2 orders of magnitude below the logit scale |
| typical top-2 logit gap | ~0.5–5 nats | 0.184 is ~9% of a 2-nat gap — enough to flip greedy *only* in near-ties |
| PPL (wikitext-2, Q8_0 model) | 6.3162 / 6.3563, **identical** to pre-block-10 | the aggregate output distribution is unaffected |
| greedy streams | deterministic *within* a build; 1 of 3 test prompts diverged at 1 character | flips only when two logits sit within the drift of each other |

### Honest framing of the numbers

An earlier draft of this note described the drift as "four orders of
magnitude below the temperature scale." That phrasing is **not accurate** and
is not used here. A 0.184 logit difference is ~20% relative probability on
the single most-affected token at t=1.0 — small relative to the logit scale
(~2 orders below typical magnitudes) and small enough that PPL is
bit-unchanged, but it is *not* vanishingly small. What keeps it benign in
practice:

1. It is a **max** over all tokens; typical logits drift far less.
2. PPL — the aggregate measure of output quality — is bit-identical.
3. Greedy output changes only when the top-2 logit gap happens to be smaller
   than the drift (a near-tie), which is why 1 of 3 prompts diverged at a
   single character and the other 2 did not diverge at all.

If you require bit-exact greedy reproduction of stock, exclude block 10. If
you require a *correct, deterministic, high-quality* model, block 10 is
unambiguously fine: it is one of many valid rounding paths, and the evidence
shows it neither helps nor hurts what the model produces — only whether the
bits match stock's arbitrary-but-pinned order.

## 7. Practical guidance

- **Within a single build:** greedy output is fully deterministic, with or
  without block 10. The variance only appears when comparing *different
  builds* (block 10 in vs out, flash-attn on vs off).
- **Reproducing stock bits:** exclude `10-k-quant-boosts.patch` (it is
  applied last; one-line change in `scripts/apply-all.sh`). This restores
  every VDR constant and the RDNA3_5 table to stock values, so the reduction
  order matches upstream exactly, on RDNA3, RDNA3_5 and RDNA4 alike.
- **Mixing the two:** do not apply block 10 partially or hand-tune VDR
  values in production builds that must match stock — any deviation from the
  stock association order is a new rounding path and breaks bit-reproduction
  just as surely as block 10 does.
- **Comparisons:** when A/B testing block 10 against stock, compare
  *distributions* (PPL, benchmark scores, sampling quality), not individual
  greedy tokens — individual tokens are expected to differ in near-ties, in
  exactly the same way they differ between flash-attn on and off.
