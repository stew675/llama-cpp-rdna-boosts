# llama-cpp-rdna-boosts

A patch collection that brings **AMD RDNA-specific performance work** to
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp): MTP decode, chunked
gated-delta-net prefill, BF16 KV and WMMA flash-attention, fused MoE and
k-quant decode paths, a hybrid all-reduce, qwen4exp (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next)
support, and an attention-memory campaign that frees several GiB of VRAM.

It ships as **16 patches** (block 00 + blocks 01-15) for a clean llama.cpp
checkout at the fork point **`ebbb18522`** (upstream master, 2026-09-17
re-base).  Each block is a self-contained `git am` commit, so you can apply
the whole set or pick the ones you want:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp && cd llama.cpp
git checkout ebbb18522
bash <path-to-this-repo>/scripts/apply-all.sh .   # creates branch rdna-boosts
```

## Releases

Frozen deliveries are published as GitHub Releases and tagged in this repo
(the tag is the release identity: `v16-<fork-point>-r<N>`, e.g.
**`v16-ebbb18522-r1`**, where `r1` is the re-base and each later release on the
same base increments `N`).  `release.json.release` must equal the tag — CI
checks it — and only a tag push cuts a release.  Each release carries
`rdna-boosts-all.patch`, `patches.tar.gz`, `release.json`
and `SHA256SUMS`, so a consumer can pin a tag and verify the artifacts instead
of tracking a moving `main`.

`release.json` is the delivery's single source of truth (fork point, canonical
tip/tree, block count, per-artifact sha256); `scripts/apply-all.sh`,
`scripts/validate-set.sh` and CI all read it.  The container pipeline is
**tag-driven**, so ordinary commits to `main` (docs / benchmarks / `WORKLOG.md`)
only run the cheap patch validation — see [`CONTAINERS.md`](CONTAINERS.md) for
the release process and the prebuilt ROCm images.

## Supported architectures

The set targets the **RDNA3 / RDNA3.5 / RDNA4** GPU families:

| family | arches | example parts |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| RDNA 3 | `gfx1100` | RX 7900 XTX/XT, RX 7800 XT, ... |
| RDNA 3.5 | `gfx1150`/`gfx1151` | Strix Point / Strix Halo APUs |
| RDNA 4 | `gfx1200`/`gfx1201` | RX 9060 XT; RX 9070 / 9070 XT |

**RDNA4 (gfx120x) sees the most benefit** — the WMMA flash-attn path, the
chunked-GDN kernel, the k-quant VDR boosts and block 12's internal
all-reduce were all first built and validated there. As much of that work
as possible is back-ported to the RDNA3/3.5 families instead of being
gated off:

- block 02's **chunked gated-delta-net** bf16/WMMA prefill ships as two
  arch-segregated kernels: a dedicated first-gen WMMA port for gfx11
  (`gated_delta_net_chunked_bf16_gfx11.cu`) next to the RDNA4 kernel;
- block 04's **WMMA flash-attn** is *not* RDNA4-only despite the block
  name — RDNA3.0 runs it with the same 576-head limit as RDNA4, RDNA3.5
  with a tuned 320-head limit;
- block 10 adds a **dedicated RDNA3.5 mmvq parameter table** (previously
  folded into the RDNA2 fallback) on top of the RDNA4 k-quant boosts.

Arch selection is **runtime** everywhere in the set (device `cc` /
`gcnArchName`; there is no compile-time arch gating), so a multi-arch
build such as `GPU_TARGETS="gfx1100;gfx1151;gfx1201"` yields one binary
that picks the right path on whichever of these it runs on. The one
genuine exception is **block 12** — its internal all-reduce is RDNA4-only
(gfx1200/gfx1201) and falls back to RCCL elsewhere (see
`patches/README.md` for the gate and env knobs).  Block 13's fused
MoE MMQ gate now covers RDNA4 + RDNA3_5 + RDNA3_0 (gfx1151 validated
2026-09-05, gfx1100 validated 2026-09-05 — see
[Current state](#current-state)).

## The 16 blocks

| patch | what |
|-------|------|
| `0000` | **structural and architecture fixes** — FA small-batch KV-split width invariance (issue #25) + Vulkan masked-V/freed-cell fixes (dead columns never read V). The base every later block applies on top of. |
| `0001` | adaptive MTP draft depth (`--draft-mtp-adaptive`) |
| `0002` | fused chunked gated-delta-net prefill kernel (bf16/WMMA, arch-segregated gfx12/gfx11) |
| `0003` | BF16 KV cache + native-BF16 flash-attn (+ the HIP masked-V/freed-cell fixes since 2026-09-10) |
| `0004` | RDNA4 WMMA flash-attn + Q6_K mmq prefill perf (WMMA path also runs on RDNA3.0/3.5, tuned head limits) |
| `0005` | CPU bit-identical decode/verify batches |
| `0006` | host-buffer revert for discrete GPUs |
| `0007` | meta device-wrapper skip |
| `0008` | fused-core prefill kernels + GPU bit-identical results (needs blocks 03+04; amended 2026-09-07 with the mul_mat+add through-view shape guard, PR #15) |
| `0009` | meta-buffer compute-container headroom |
| `0010` | k-quant-boosts: Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K/Q8_0 mmvq VDR (+ q8_1 quantize-cache fusions; adds a dedicated RDNA3.5 mmvq table) |
| `0011` | skip CUDA graphs for multi-token PRE-FILL (decode keeps graph replay) |
| `0012` | **hybrid HIP all-reduce** — custom internal AR for the small-tensor decode path, per-size hybrid dispatch vs RCCL, RDNA4-only gate (bounded in-kernel spin since 2026-08-30 fix round; builds without RCCL) |
| `0013` | **fused MoE gate+up+GLU MMQ + mmvq short-K item-split** — prefill fused expert MMQ (RDNA4 + RDNA3_5 + RDNA3_0, Q3_K/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q8_0/Q6_K, env opt-out `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MOE_MMQ_FUSION`) + decode item-split (rpb 2/4/8) merged with the upstream has_fusion mmvq path |
| `0014` | **qwen4exp / Qwen3.8-Flash-Next support** — QSA sparse FA (default) + fused indexer top-k, HC_MIX/HC_COMBINE fused decode ops, managed lazy reader, MTP draft-head, WS4 hyperconn prefill fusions, QSA decode campaign + per-arch dense/QSA decode policy (promoted from `beta/qwen4exp`; see `patches/README.md` block-14 notes). The masked-V/freed-cell fixes it once carried now live in blocks 00 (Vulkan) and 03 (HIP). |
| `0015` | **attention-memory wins (block 15)** — promoted 2026-09-12 from `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/`: **V3** derived kq mask (`LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED`, on by default), **V4** native q8_0 + **V5** native bf16 K/V in the FA kernels (both behind `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE`, opt-in default 0), **W1** QSA score-chain memory (`GGML_QSA_SCORE_MEM`), **W2** derived QSA per-block bias + visibility (`GGML_QSA_DERIVED_BIAS`/`GGML_QSA_DERIVED_VIS`), **W3** keys-only QSA indexer cache (`LLAMA_QSA_KEYS_ONLY`), **W4** ggml-alloc unused-view release (no gate; A/B revert in `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/ab/`).  ~3.4 GiB/GPU + ~1.2 GiB host saved on qwen4exp, ~800 MiB/GPU + ~800 MiB host on dense models, at ~1.3 % prefill / ~0.3 % decode. |

> [`GREEDY-PURITY.md`](GREEDY-PURITY.md). **Block-13 caveat (2026-09-02):**
> block 13 rewrites the small-batch mmvq decode kernel and is a second

## Consumer workflow

```
# 1. fresh clone of llama.cpp, at the fork point recorded in release.json
BASE=$(jq -r .base release.json)          # from this repo
FORK=https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
git clone $FORK && cd llama.cpp
git checkout "$BASE"

# 2. apply the set (automated; strict 16/16 git am on the recorded base)
bash <path-to-this-repo>/scripts/apply-all.sh .
#    = git am patches/0000…0015  (one commit per block on a fresh `rdna-boosts` branch)

# 3. build + verify (trim -DGPU_TARGETS to your GPU arch for a faster build)
cmake -B build -DGGML_HIP=ON -DGGML_HIP_RCCL=1 -DGPU_TARGETS="gfx1100;gfx1151;gfx1201" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
# coherence gate (same-seed output must match a known-good build):
./build/bin/llama-cli -m <model> -ngl 99 -sm tensor -mg 0 -p "The capital of France is" \
  -n 20 --seed 42 --temp 0 --no-display-prompt --single-turn
```

> **Do not use `git apply` on the concatenated 1-11 series** — it silently
> drops hunks (30 files / 2483 lines vs the correct 35 / 6094, verified
> 2026-08-29). `git am` (or `scripts/apply-all.sh`) is the required flow.

### Manual equivalent

```bash
git am patches/000[1-9]-*.patch patches/001[0-5]-*.patch   # blocks 01-15
git add -A && git commit -m "rdna-boosts: block 15: campaign memory wins"
```

## Recommended configuration — adaptive MTP + `ngram-mod`

The best general-purpose speculative-decoding configuration measured on this delivery combines the
**adaptive MTP controller** with the draftless **`ngram-mod`** speculator:

```bash
--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive,ngram-mod \
  --spec-ngram-mod-n-match 45 \
  --spec-draft-n-max 9 --spec-draft-n-start 9
```

`ngram-mod` supplies the long verbatim-recall drafts the MTP head cannot match, while the adaptive
controller keeps the MTP depth right for everything else.  Measured against plain `draft-mtp-adaptive`
on the Q8_0 2-GPU reference cell (`-n 3000`, a 4-prompts-per-axis corpus): **recall +67.5 %,
code +0.8 %, prose +0.5 %, reasoning −1.9 %, overall +13.6 %**; on the dense 1-card cell it is
code/prose-neutral with the same recall win.  The small reasoning cost is the price of the deeper
`n-max 9`; a workload with no verbatim recall is marginally better served by plain
`draft-mtp-adaptive`.

Guidance:

* **Cap.**  `9` is the general-purpose pick and the optimum on a **single card** (a cap of `6` costs
  11-14 % on code there).  On a **multi-card tensor split** `6-7` is ~1 % better.  A lower cap saves
  only a small verify-batch scratch, not the model/KV memory.
* **`n_match`.**  Keep it `>= 40` **and an integer multiple of the cap** — `9/45`, `8/48`, `6/42`.
  Too short (`nm24`) makes ngram fire on incidental code repeats and lose code throughput; a
  non-multiple (e.g. `nm42` at cap 12) degrades acceptance.
* The combo changes the draft strategy, so it is **opt-in** — the controller default stays plain
  `--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive`.

## When upstream master moves

The patches are static against the fork point in `release.json.base`. When upstream
drifts and hunks no longer apply, re-base the block commits (the fork checkout carries
them), regenerate the whole set with `scripts/make-patches.sh`, then refresh
`release.json` (`scripts/make-release.sh --base … --tip … --tree …`) and update the
current-state headers. The old `baseline/<sha>`-branch-per-upstream-range workflow
was retired when the delivery moved to the flat 16-patch set on `main`.

## Upstreaming

Some blocks are candidates for upstream contribution to
[ggml-org/llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp); others are
expected to stay fork-local. Block 12's internal all-reduce is gated to
RDNA4 pending community verification on RDNA3 pairs. See `MANIFESTS.md`
for per-block verification and `BASELINE.md` for provenance.

## Current state

- **16-patch set** (block 00 + blocks 01-15) for llama.cpp at the fork point
  **`ebbb18522`** (upstream master "openvino : Update OpenVINO to 2026.4", 2026-09-17 re-base).
- Canonical 16-block chain: tip **`ba9e18cacfa3f97f13a822dded971eeb2cce2480`**, net tree
  **`b84b1783f7207e25600403df5a8e98c183b9f80a`**; release **`v16-ebbb18522-r4`**.
- **gfx1100 (RDNA3_0) tensor split keeps the stock AMD FA `ncols2` rule** (block 04, issue #30):
  the 2026-09-14 split-aware hint (wider generic `ncols2` for tensor-split attention) was RDNA4-tuned
  and cost RDNA3_0 deep prefill (`pp100K` 667.5 -> 779.4 t/s on 2× RX 7900 XTX, stock 805.0; decode
  unchanged).  A single gfx1100 card is unaffected (it already took the AMD rule).
- `--fit` no longer SIGSEGVs with `--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive` and a minimal per-tier MTP
  head (issue #38; block 01, one line in `common/common.cpp`).
- A clean HIP build no longer prints the ~10k FA "loop not unrolled" warnings
  (`-Wno-pass-failed`, block 15; no codegen change).
- Patches `patches/0000-…0015-…` apply with **strict 16/16 `git am`** (no 3-way
  fallback, whitespace-clean) via `scripts/apply-all.sh`.  `scripts/validate-set.sh`
  re-checks the artifact hashes, the strict apply and the applied tree against `release.json`.
- **`hybrid` is the default all-reduce**; `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=ce` selects the opt-in
  copy-engine (SDMA) 2-GPU mode and `=nccl` forces RCCL.
- **Greedy purity**: plain decode == `draft-mtp` verify for `--spec-draft-n-max <= 7`
  across the supported KV types.  Depths 8..15 are allowed with a visible notice (a
  verify wider than 8 rows switches kernel family); `> 15` is clamped (the recurrent
  rollback snapshot bound).
- Last full `test-backend-ops` on this cut (gfx1201): **18083/18083**, with
  `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5952/5952** and `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` **22/22**.

The **dated record of every change** (re-bases, block amendments, issue fixes,
measurements) is [`WORKLOG.md`](WORKLOG.md), newest first.  Per-block notes, env knobs
and server configuration live in [`patches/README.md`](patches/README.md); apply order
and the verification contract in [`MANIFESTS.md`](MANIFESTS.md); fork point and drift
policy in [`BASELINE.md`](BASELINE.md); the purity rulebook in
[`GREEDY-PURITY.md`](GREEDY-PURITY.md).

## Inspirational Works

While most of the work in this repository are original works of my own, there are
some significant portions, most notably around the prefill tuning, inspired by the
excellent work performed by the community of: https://github.com/halo-box/strix-llama.cpp

Thank you to all the maintainers of the Strix Halo Llama.cpp project

Of course none of this would be possible without the baseline that all of this rests
